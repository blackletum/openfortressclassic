# Open Fortress Classic

A compiled version of the last public Open Fortress code before it went closed source in July 2020. This allows you to play the game alongside modern O.F.

Unfortunately, the linux compile failed so I cannot provide the necessary SO files. If you play on Linux, please try to use Proton instead. I am not a programmer so this is beyond my capabilities to fix.
